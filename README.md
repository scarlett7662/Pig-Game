# Pig-Game
Pig Game Rules:
Objective:
The goal of the Pig Game is to be the first player to reach a certain number of points, usually 100.

Gameplay:
The game is typically played with two players.
On a player's turn, they roll a six-sided die and accumulate points.
The player can roll the die multiple times on their turn, with each roll adding to their current turn total.
If a player rolls a 1, their turn total is reset to 0, and they lose the points accumulated during that turn.
The player can choose to "hold," which adds the turn total to their overall score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
Winning:
The first player to reach or exceed the target score (usually 100) wins the game.
Special Cases:
If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose the points for that turn.
Players can choose to hold at any time during their turn to secure their points.
Tips:
Players need to decide when to hold and secure their points to avoid losing them.
Rolling a 1 can be risky, so players need to weigh the decision to roll again.
